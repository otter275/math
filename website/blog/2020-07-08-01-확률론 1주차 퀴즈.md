## 1. Smoking and Lung Cancer

Suppose 0.1% of the American population currently has lung cancer, that 90% of all lung cancer cases are smokers, and that 21% of those without lung cancer also smoke. (These values are fairly close to the values given on the American Lung Association web site as of 2011.) Consider the following questions.
 
    What percent of smokers have lung cancer?
    What percent of non-smokers have lung cancer?
    How much more likely is a smoker to have lung cancer than a non-smoker?

## 2. False Positives

 One prominent manufacturer of medical tests offers a test for chlamydia 
(a sexually transmitted disease) that has a sensitivity of 76.4% and a specificity of 93.2%. In other words, 
the test correctly identifies 76.4% of individuals tested who have the disease by giving a positive result, and correctly identifies 93.2% of the individuals who are healthy by giving a negative result. Currently, it is estimated that 1.5% of the American population has chlamydia. If one individual is randomly selected from the population and tests positive 
for chlamydia, what is the probability that he/she does not have the disease?
